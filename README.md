Miscellaneous C++ utilities, mainly with a focus on math and computer vision using OpenCV.

Major features:

* Computer vision
    * Hand gesture recognition framework
        * Fingertip detection
        * Color-based skin segmentation
* OSX-specific
    * Simple interface for mouse control and screen scraping
* Math
    * Implementation of [automatic differentiation][ad]
* Sequences
    * Python's "xrange" and "range"
    * Functional programming tools like "map", "filter", "any", "all"

See the documentation [here][docs].

The code relies heavily on C++11 features, so will not work with older compilers.
